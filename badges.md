## Community Distribution Story

**Results**:

## Badge Philosophy

### Transferable by Design

From founder @SQU1NCH:
- Badges are fully transferable, sellable, "do-whatever-you-wantable"
- Team considered soul-bound tokens but chose transferability
- "Everything has a price" - free market approach
- Holders are free to sell if they want

### Meaning Over Utility

- Badges mean "you were here first"
- Badges mean "you believed early"
- "This is your in" - credential for early supporters
- Value comes from community and conviction, not forced utility

### Community Freedom

- No forced holding
- Free market is the best market
- Community decides value
- "Just be good to each other and stay safe"

## Badge Lore Integration

### In-Universe Meaning

According to the latest lore (November 12 claymation video):

- **Rabbit 🐰**: Early stress tests in MITER-Corp experiments
- **Moth 🦋**: Sealed units in experimental phases
- **Snake 🐍**: Couriers for distribution and recruitment

### Story Integration

- Badges represent test subjects/operatives in experiments
- G*Boy (G304) escape causes "general chaos"
- Badge holders become "operatives" in the narrative
- Community actions woven into lore
