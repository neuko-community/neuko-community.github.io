# Project Overview

> High-level introduction to Neuko AI: what it is, why it matters, and how to get involved.

## Mission Snapshot

### What Neuko AI Is

Neuko AI is a Solana-based Web3 project that launched in mid-October 2025, combining elements of AI, NFTs, and interactive storytelling. It's built by a team of former Doodles members who emphasize organic community building, cryptic lore, and puzzle-solving over traditional marketing.

**Core Elements**:
- **Badge NFT System**: Rabbit 🐰, Moth 🦋, and Snake 🐍 badges represent different phases and serve as credentials
- **Cryptic Lore**: Story centered on G*Boy (G304), MITER-Corp experiments, and surveillance themes
- **Puzzle-Heavy**: Hidden clues in videos, audio, and website code unlock lore and rewards
- **Community-Driven**: Decentralized distribution, community-led onboarding, collaborative puzzle-solving
- **100% Organic**: No paid promotions, partnerships, or KOL deals

**Current Status** (as of November 2025):
- ~13,462 followers on X (up from 0 in early October)
- Over 1,100 unique badge holders
- Strong floor prices, only 2-3% listed (diamond hands)
- 0.25% mindshare (higher than many established projects)
- Team scheduled to speak at SolanaConf in early December 2025
