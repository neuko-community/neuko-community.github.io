## PIN Unlock System

### How It Works

**PIN Source**: Codes discovered through video puzzles  
**Discovery Process**: 
1. Solve puzzles in videos (Post #7 - Channel Flipping)
2. Identify community shoutouts
3. Extract hidden contrast codes
4. Get code parts from community members
5. Combine codes to form PIN

### PIN Components

**Codes Discovered** (from Post #7):
- **HOOTS-49**: From @satoshi_owl (owl hoots in audio)
- **HOPS-13**: From @CharliegNFTeth (frog gummies)
- **STAYS-28**: From @TheKeeperOfX (HEMLET CORP radios)

**Combination**: These codes combine to form the website PIN
