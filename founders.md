## Austin Hurwitz

- **Article: `austin-article.md`** — Focus on earning attention through
  craft instead of noise; "actions over words" philosophy; refusal to
  publish roadmaps. Notes on leaving Doodles to build Neuko with a
  tighter community filter.
- **Article: `austin-article-2.md`** — Mindshare metrics vs. incumbents;
  critique of mercenary tactics; personal origin story (Amazon, music
  rights) and commitment to equitable systems; invitation to drop the
  old launch playbook.

### Themes to Highlight

1. Anti-mercenary distribution philosophy (no WL grinds, no KOL deals).
2. Belief in organic myth-building: "Neuko is in the eye of the
   beholder."
3. Expectation that operatives show patience and curiosity.

## Squinch

- **Post: `squinch-post-1.md`** — Rationale for transferable badges,
  celebration of early supporters, and emphasis on being "free" even if
  that means selling. Introduces Snake wave tease.

## Greenie

- **Post: `greenie-post01.md`** — Tribute to community resilience,
  acknowledgment that conviction comes from members, not the core team.
