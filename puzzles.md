# Neuko AI Puzzles

> Complete catalog of puzzles, solutions, and puzzle-solving techniques used in Neuko AI.

## Overview

Puzzles are core to Neuko AI's engagement strategy. Hidden in videos, audio, website code, and community interactions, they unlock lore, reward engagement, and create a collaborative problem-solving culture. The team designs puzzles as social experiments, decentralizing participation and testing community conviction.

## Puzzle Philosophy

### Design Principles

**Social Experiments**: Puzzles designed to test community collaboration and conviction

**Decentralized Participation**: Community members involved in puzzle distribution and solving

**Reward Engagement**: Puzzles reward those who pay attention and contribute

**No Cheat Sheet**: Team emphasizes exploration and discovery over explicit instructions

**Collaborative Storytelling**: Puzzles weave community members into narrative

### Team Approach

- **Watching Community**: Team monitors engagement to curate puzzle distribution
- **Involving Members**: Real community members receive codes to distribute
- **Rewarding Solvers**: Shoutouts and recognition for puzzle contributors
- **Evolving Complexity**: Puzzles escalate from simple to multi-layer challenges
