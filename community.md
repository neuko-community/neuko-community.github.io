# Neuko Community

> Community culture, key members, rituals, and social experiment dynamics.

## Overview

The Neuko community is characterized by high conviction, collaborative puzzle-solving, and strong cultural identity. The team designed a social experiment around badge distribution that tested community values, resulting in a diamond-handed, engagement-focused community that self-organized to reward contribution over quick profits.

## Community Design: The Social Experiment

### The Experiment

The Snake badge distribution (Phase 3) was designed as a social experiment:

**Setup**:
- Team gave Snake badges to Rabbit and Moth holders
- Gave complete freedom: Hold, Sell, or Give
- Holders were to distribute to people they thought would benefit the community
- No team oversight or control
- Tested community values and loyalty

**Hypothesis**: In a down market, would holders sell free NFTs or demonstrate loyalty?

**Results**: 
- Most holders chose to give badges to community
- Only 2-3% listed on Magic Eden
- Community self-organized distribution
- Rewarded engagement and contribution
- Some bought badges on secondary to gift others

**Significance**: Demonstrated strong community values and conviction

## AMA Summary

### First Weekly Community Space (November 2025)

**Format**: Community call by community, for community  
**Focus**: Community, culture, and ongoing mystery (not hard shilling or roadmap)

**Key Points**:

**1. Community First, Product Second**
- Focus on people, culture, and evolving mystery
- Not classic "here is the mint date" promo
- Emphasis on community over marketing

**2. Red Hoodie as Identity Layer**
- Red hoodie PFP meme is strong
- Community pressure (jokingly) to adopt red hoodie
- Acts as soft filter and visible signal of belonging

**3. Puzzles, Lore, and Thinkers**
- Attracts people who enjoy decoding and storytelling
- Some see scattered dots, others connect everything
- Not just chasing floor price

**4. Organic Reach**
- Short early video spread organically
- Reached timelines of people who usually only see DeFi content
- Strong sign that visuals and meme are powerful

**5. Credible Team**
- Doxxed team with real track record
- Mix of mystery on top and proven builders underneath
- Early supporters feel comfortable leaning in

**6. Culture, IRL Energy, Social Capital**
- Goal is not only digital speculation
- Brand and community where people stay for relationships
- Events and shared rituals

**7. Consistency as Currency**
- Personal challenges (100-day running streak) linked to Web3 consistency
- Showing up, contributing, keeping promises = value
- Consistency treated as its own form of value

**Conclusion**: People are not just betting on future drop, they're buying into a culture. Neuko is turning red hoodies, puzzles, and shared rituals into a social layer people want to belong to.

## Community Social Experiment Analysis

### Game Theory Elements

**1. Status and Tribal Identity**
- Badges create status and belonging
- Community-led distribution tests loyalty
- Creates sense of tribe and identity

**2. Reciprocity and Trust Signaling**
- Giving away valuable NFTs demonstrates loyalty
- Recipients feel indebted and emotionally invested
- Emotional reciprocity creates stickiness

**3. Cooperative Scarcity**
- Low listings (2-3%) create cooperative equilibrium
- Most holders aligned with long-term goals
- Coordination game playing out in real time

**4. Delayed Revelation & Narrative Suspense**
- Mystery sustains belief
- Each holder becomes part of story arc
- Sunk cost fallacy + consistency bias

**5. Skin in the Game**
- High entry price ($300+) filters for true believers
- Speculators deterred by uncertain future
- Core of value-aligned, emotionally invested holders

**6. Low Supply, High Conviction Loop**
- Scarcity + loyalty = liquidity crunch
- Low listings → steady floor → public perception of strength
- Attracts long-term interest → reinforces loyalty
