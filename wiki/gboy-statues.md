# G*BOY Statues

The G*BOY vinyl statues were launched as a response to community demand for a tangible representation of the G*BOY character. Unlike many web3 physical drops that rely on hype or speculative mechanics, this collection was created purely because the community asked for it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are these?
G*BOY 1st Edition 6" Vinyl Statues are tokenized full sized figurine mystery boxes. Each contains one 1st edition G*BOY figurine colorway. You receive a cNFT representing your sealed box, which you can trade or claim for the physical item.

### When will I receive my figurine?
You receive your cNFT instantly upon purchasing. Physical claims will open when the figurines are ready to ship - estimates at launch were around 3 months from sale. Once claims open, shipping takes 5-10 business days.

### How do I claim the physical figurine?
Claims will open into the future when the figurines are ready to ship. Once available, go to your Phygitals profile, select your G*BOY blind boxes, and click 'Claim'. Enter your shipping details, and the physical item will be sent to you.

### Is this the G*BOY NFT collection?
No - this is not the G*BOY NFT collection. This is the official G*BOY NFT 1st Edition 6" Vinyl Statue Figurines Drop, powered by Phygitals. Each NFT represents ownership of an authentic G*BOY blind box.

### Which colorway will I get?
It's a mystery! Each box contains a unique G*BOY colorway, randomly selected. The specific colorway is not revealed digitally - you'll discover which one you got when you open the physical box in real life.
