We did not yet know what they wanted or if they were a friend or foe.<br><br> Many of the community member sprang into action, demanding proof of life. The Bloc seemed annoyed by this, yet met our demands by broadcasting this transmission.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><a href="https://twitter.com/thrax_nft/status/1992315393218879914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote><p> This was the relief we needed to stop worrying, and prepare to receive any follow-up communication.</p><p>The said about our Thrax, and I quote:</p><blockquote><p>“he&#39;s fiiine. eating all our food though.” </p></blockquote><p>I have discovered this is was not an exaggeration.</p><p><br> One community member, however, was not buying it. <a href="https://x.com/BAGFILLERR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@Ruzlu</a> put his ear to the ground, and started tracking the homie. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><a href="https://twitter.com/BAGFILLERR/status/1992399889129697557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote><p>It was an epic effort… actually- come to think of it, is he still out there? Someone should let him know Thrax has been returned. Not me though, I’m a little scared of him. Anyway- check out his video logs of his efforts. They are thrilling. Mfer has a lab!</p><p>Anyway… where was I…. oh right- Yesterday we finally receive the transmission we were waiting for; the Bloc was ready to talk. The transmission was queued and I literally did nothing but stare at my phone until we finally got the next message. My wife, my daughter and my boss were pissed. They did not believe that I was an operative trying to save a friend… like, I mean, c’mon. It’s not that hard to believe, right?… right?</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><a href="https://twitter.com/thrax_nft/status/1993708253147201959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote><p>The message finally came through— and it was fucking gibberish.

These are the same fools that were on that call (without me) when G304 showed up in Canada, remember!? This is when I realized it was an encrypted message… and I spotted something.<br><br> In Thrax’s message there was a timestamp: <code>1997-03-02</code> .</p><p>I had seen this before, in the SJ-Securelab/Miter logs that The Bloc leaked a while back. I pulled up my records and found the exact entry. It said:</p><blockquote><p>[1997-03-02 | Ellard, J.]<br> The chamber hum is lower this week. New power routing, maybe. Everyone swears the tone shifted, but we cannot agree on whether it rose or fell. U-021 sat through six cycles without complaint. When we pulled him out, his pupils stayed wide and empty for nearly a minute. He said it was fine. He said the quiet felt like “a sponge.” Whatever that means. I left that part out of the formal report.</p></blockquote><p>The message lined up perfectly, but there was still one more part of the message that I didn’t appear from the logs- the very last line of the gibberish in the post was: <code>JLTO IGLFP EGCHM</code><br><br></p><p>I went to my robot companion and fed him the encrypted message and the decrypted log that I think it corresponded to. My robot friend congratulated me profusely and complemented my incredible intelligence (it tells me that a lot, no biggie) and told me yes- the encrypted message did in fact line up with the logs. I requested it reverse-engineer the cypher key for me so I could use it to decrypt that last piece of the message.</p><p>It gave me this key: <code>heseatingallmyfood</code> , or ”He’s eating all my food&quot;</p><p>…The Bloc is sour about this, bro…</p><p>Anyway- the decrypted message using this website: <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher</a>.<br> Passing the whole of the original message into the decode side, with the key, it gave me back the following:</p><blockquote><p>Recovered Log -- 1997-03-02 | Ellard, J. -- NODE05<br> “The chamber hum is lower this week.
