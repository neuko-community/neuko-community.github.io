## What You Need to Know in 5 Minutes

### What is Neuko?

Neuko is a Solana-based Web3 project combining elements of AI, NFTs, and interactive storytelling. It's built by a team of former Doodles members who emphasize organic community building, cryptic lore, and puzzle-solving over traditional marketing.

**Key Points**:
- **Cryptic Mystery Project**: No explicit roadmap, emphasis on discovery
- **Badge NFT System**: Rabbit 🐰, Moth 🐝, and Snake 🐍 badges represent different phases
- **Community-Driven**: Decentralized distribution, community-led onboarding
- **Puzzle-Heavy**: Hidden clues in videos, audio, and website code
- **100% Organic**: No paid promotions, partnerships, or KOL deals

### Current Status

- **Followers**: Growing community on X (started from 0 in October 2025)
- **Badge Holders**: Over 1,100 unique holders
- **Badge Distribution**: 3 phases complete (Rabbit, Moth, Snake)
- **Market Performance**: Strong floor prices, low listing percentage (diamond hands)
- **Community**: Active puzzle-solving, community-driven content, high conviction

### Are You Too Late?

**No!** The project is still early:
- Launched in October 2025
- Still many mysteries unsolved
- More to come (team emphasizes "we're still building")
