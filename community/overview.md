# Neuko Community

> Community culture, key members, rituals, and social experiment dynamics.

## Overview

The Neuko community is characterized by high conviction, collaborative puzzle-solving, and strong cultural identity. The team designed a social experiment around badge distribution that tested community values, resulting in a diamond-handed, engagement-focused community that self-organized to reward contribution over quick profits.

## Core Values

### 1. Engagement Over Extraction

- Rewards those who interact, create, and contribute
- No whitelist grinds or mercenary tactics
- Community values authenticity

### 2. Collaboration Over Competition

- Puzzle-solving is collaborative
- Community members help each other
- Shared knowledge and discoveries

### 3. Conviction Over Quick Flips

- Diamond hands (low sell pressure)
- Long-term thinking
- Belief in the project and team

### 4. Mystery and Discovery

- Attracts "dot-connectors" who enjoy decoding
- No explicit roadmap or cheat sheet
- Exploration and interpretation valued

## Community Philosophy

### Team Approach

**Watching Community**: Team actively monitors engagement to curate puzzle distribution and recognize contributors

**Involving Members**: Real community members receive codes to distribute, blurring fiction and reality

**Rewarding Engagement**: Shoutouts, recognition, and involvement in puzzles for active contributors

**No Mercenary Tactics**: No paid KOLs, partnerships, or backdoor deals

### Community Response

**Diamond Hands**: Strong conviction, low sell pressure (2-3% listed)

**Self-Organization**: Community organized distribution channels and onboarding

**Collaboration**: Puzzle-solving and content creation are collaborative

**Culture Building**: Memes, rituals, and shared identity markers
