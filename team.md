### Personal Origin Story

**Background**: Got into crypto in 2017 while working on music rights at Amazon  
**Experience**: 
- Saw firsthand how centralized systems kept power concentrated at the top
- Discovered people trying to decentralize those systems
- Spent years helping independent artists leverage crypto
- Worked with early pioneers like Sound.xyz and Catalog
- Built tools for artists the traditional system told couldn't own their own music

**Philosophy**: 
- "When appropriately leveraged, crypto can be an overwhelming force for good"
- Commitment to equitable systems, not extraction
- Belief in community resilience

### Key Quotes

> "We have tried to take a very different strategy. Actions over words (except my occasional ramblings here). Work product over vision statements."

> "We believe attention comes to those who earn it over the long run. That quantity only serves us when it is quality."

> "Neuko is in the eye of the beholder. It has plenty to say but only if you take the time to truly listen."

> "We do not seek to replicate playbooks because to do so would be inauthentic to who we are or how we seek to build."

> "We started Neuko with a core belief that there were other people like us. Who wanted to build fun shit on the internet with their friends."

## SQU1NCH

### Badge Philosophy

**Transferable by Design**:
- Badges are fully transferable, sellable, "do-whatever-you-wantable"
- Team considered soul-bound tokens but chose transferability
- "Everything has a price" - free market approach
- Holders are free to sell if they want

**Meaning Over Utility**:
- Badges mean "you were here first"
- Badges mean "you believed early"
- "This is your in" - credential for early supporters
- Value comes from community and conviction

**Community Freedom**:
- "You are free" - no forced holding
- "A free market is the best market"
- "Just be good to each other and stay safe"

### Key Quotes

> "these tokens are fully transferable, sellable, do-whatever-you-wantable."

> "they mean you were here first. they mean you believed early. this is your in."

> "but the most the most important thing of all, is you are free."

> "so if you don't want to keep your badge, sell it. a free market is the best market."

### Community Appreciation

**Tribute to Community**:
- Recognition of people who show up, build, create, share
- Acknowledgment of those fighting battles no one sees
- Appreciation for energy to believe despite challenges

**Community Conviction**:
- "the fact that what we've built even makes selling an impossible choice for people is humbling"
- "anyone could sell and quietly exit, but they stay because this means something to them"
- "but the truth is, we didn't build that part. you did."

**Community Support**:
- "this community has supported each other like none i've ever seen"
- "it has so much heart. the people here are real and they're all fucking beautiful"
- "people here create for each other, lift each other up, and pour energy into everything they touch"

### Key Quotes

> "been thinking a lot about the people that make @neukoai what it is. the ones who show up, build, create, share, and hold on when it'd be easier to walk away."

> "we gave people a reason to join, but you give them a reason to stay."

## Team Philosophy

### Building Approach

**Quality Over Quantity**:

- Emphasis on quality content over constant posting

**Organic Growth**:
- No paid promotions
- No partnerships or KOL deals
- 100% organic engagement
- "Actions speak loudly"

**Community First**:
- Building for community, not mercenaries
- Building for long-term, not quick flip
- Building for equity, not extraction
- "We're building something designed for equity, not extraction"
