# Getting Started with Neuko

> A quick guide for newcomers to understand what Neuko is and how to get involved.

## What You Need to Know in 5 Minutes

### What is Neuko?

Neuko is a Solana-based Web3 project that launched in mid-October 2025, combining elements of AI, NFTs, and interactive storytelling. It's built by a team of former Doodles members who emphasize organic community building, cryptic lore, and puzzle-solving over traditional marketing.

**Key Points**:
- **Cryptic Mystery Project**: No explicit roadmap, emphasis on discovery
- **Badge NFT System**: Rabbit 🐰, Moth 🐝, and Snake 🐍 badges represent different phases
- **Community-Driven**: Decentralized distribution, community-led onboarding
- **Puzzle-Heavy**: Hidden clues in videos, audio, and website code
- **100% Organic**: No paid promotions, partnerships, or KOL deals

### Current Status (as of November 2025)

- **Followers**: ~13,462 on X (up from 0 in early October)
- **Badge Holders**: Over 1,100 unique holders
- **Badge Distribution**: 3 phases complete (Rabbit, Moth, Snake)
- **Market Performance**: Strong floor prices, only 2-3% listed (diamond hands)
- **Mindshare**: 0.25% (higher than many established projects)
- **Upcoming**: Team speaking at SolanaConf in early December 2025

### Are You Too Late?

**No!** The project is still very early:
- Only ~1 month old (launched October 2025)
- Still many mysteries unsolved
- More to come (team emphasizes "we're still building")
- Community actively onboarding newcomers
