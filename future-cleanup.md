## Cleanup Status

### Ready for Archive

All critical information from `sources/` has been successfully ported to organized wiki pages. The `sources/` directory can now be:

1. **Archived** - Move to `archives/sources/` for historical reference
2. **Deleted** - Remove if archival is not needed (information is preserved in wiki pages with citations)

### Recommendation

**Keep sources archived** for:
- Historical reference
- Verification of citations
- Future updates if new information emerges
- Research purposes

**Archive Location**: `archives/sources/` (create if archiving)

### Verification

All wiki pages include source citations (e.g., `sources/thread-5.md`) pointing back to original files. This maintains provenance while keeping the wiki organized and newcomer-friendly.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All information ported - **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ Cross-references added - **COMPLETE**
3. ✅ Source citations included - **COMPLETE**
4. ⏭️ Archive or delete `sources/` directory (optional)
5. ⏭️ Update any external references if `sources/` is moved/deleted
